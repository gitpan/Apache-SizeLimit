Fix Can't call method "child_terminate" on an undefined value
By add_cleanup_handler() pass $r to _exit_if_to_big() via shift
[David Wheeler <david@kineticode.com>]

=item 0.9 2006-07-12

Copied from the mod_perl 1 core for an independent CPAN release.
[Philip M. Gollucci <pgollucci@p6m7g8.com>]

Added support for using Linux::Smaps (on Linux only, obviously) to
get much more accurate shared memory numbers on 2.6.x kernels. Taken
from Apache2::SizeLimit.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Added support for using Linux::Pid to get the parent pid on
Linux. This fixes a long-standing bug that caused this module to never
actually kill a process when using Perl 5.8.1+ on Linux.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Added new OO methods for configuring the module,
C<set_max_process_size()>, C<set_min_shared_size()> ,and
C<set_max_unshared_size()>.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Added a new method, C<add_cleanup_handler()>.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Documentation for new API, as well as lots of general work on the
docs.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Much code refactoring.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Added many tests for both the new and deprecated APIs.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Deprecated use of globals and the existing C<setmax()>, C<setmin()>,
and C<setmax_unshared()> functions.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

When calling C<setmax()>, C<setmin()>, and C<setmax_unshared()>,
only add Apache::SizeLimit as a cleanup handler once, not once for
each function call. Taken from Apache2::SizeLimit.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]

Fixed calculation of shared memory on BSD.
[Philip M. Gollucci <pgollucci@p6m7g8.com>]

Removed support for OSX, because testing shows that BSD::Resource is
not working on that platform.
[Dave Rolsky <autarch@urth.org>]
